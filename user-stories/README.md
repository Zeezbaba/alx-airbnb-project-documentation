# ðŸ“˜ User Stories - Airbnb Clone Backend

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task was to **translate the use case diagram interactions** into actionable user stories. These stories represent the core functionalities that users (guests, hosts, and admins) need to perform on the platform.

User stories serve as the **foundation for backend development**, providing a user-centric perspective that guides API design, database modeling, and business logic implementation.

## ðŸ§© What We Did

Based on the use case diagram created in the previous task, we identified the main **actors** (Guest, Host, Admin) and their interactions with the system. We then translated each of these interactions into simple, understandable user stories.

Each story follows the standard user story format:

> "As a [user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal]."

This helps clarify **why** a feature is needed and what **value** it delivers to the user.
